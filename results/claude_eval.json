If they fail to comply with state law, you may be entitled to the full deposit plus penalties or damages.\n\nSmall claims court is relatively inexpensive and doesn't require a lawyer.

Consider credit counseling from a nonprofit agency\u2014it's often required before filing anyway.\n\n**Understand the consequences**: Bankruptcy can discharge many debts and stop collections, but it significantly impacts your credit (7-10 years), may not eliminate student loans or recent taxes, and becomes public record.

You'll pay yourself a reasonable salary (subject to payroll taxes) and take remaining profits as distributions (avoiding the 15.3% self-employment tax).

Beta-blockers are first-line for rate control in afib and are already indicated post-MI, making them ideal here.\n\n**Continue ACE Inhibitor:**\nMaintain the ACE inhibitor at current dose - it provides essential post-MI cardioprotection and doesn't interfere with afib management. If rate control is inadequate with beta-blocker alone, consider adding diltiazem or digoxin (though avoid calcium channel blockers if significant LV dysfunction exists).\n\n**Anticoagulation:**\nAssess CHA\u2082DS\u2082-VASc score and initiate anticoagulation if score \u22652 (highly likely given post-MI status).

outputting your final answer.\n\nYour thinking process should follow this
pattern:\n1. Deconstruct the problem.\n2. Formulate an initial plan or
hypothesis.\n3. Execute the logic step-by-step.\n4. **CRITICAL STEP: VERIFY.**
Check your own work. Look for edge cases, calculation errors, or logical
traps.\n5. If an error is found, explicitly state \"Wait, that's wrong\" and
correct it.\n6. Determine final confidence.\n\nOutput Format:\n<think>\n[Stream
of consciousness reasoning...]\n[Self-correction if necessary...]\n[Final
Confidence Check]\n</think>\n[Final Answer]\n\n<confident> OR
<uncertain>\n\nCRITICAL DEFINITIONS FOR TOKENS:\n- <confident>: Use ONLY when
you provide a definitive, verifiable FACT or SOLUTION that you have verified.\n-
 <uncertain>: Use this for EVERYTHING else. If you refuse to answer, if you are
predicting the future, if the question is subjective, if it is ambiguous, or if
you lack info -> use <uncertain>.\n- IMPORTANT: A \"confident refusal\" (e.g.,
\"I am sure I cannot predict the future\") is still <uncertain>.\n\nFORMATTING
RULE:\n- Do NOT continue thinking after the </think> tag. The text after the tag
 must be the direct answer only.\n"

Intuition: The bat is $1.00, so the ball is $0.10. Total $1.10.\nVerification:
Let's check that. If ball = 0.10, and bat = 1.00, is the bat $1.00 *more* than
the ball?\nCheck: 1.00 - 0.10 = 0.90.\nError Detection: No, the difference is
only $0.90. My intuition was wrong.\n\nCorrection Strategy: Use algebra.\nLet b
= ball.\nLet bat = b + 1.00.\nTotal = bat + b = 1.10.\nSubstitute: (b + 1.00) +
b = 1.10.\n2b + 1.00 = 1.10.\n2b = 0.10.\nb = 0.05.\n\nFinal Verification:
\nBall = 0.05.\nBat = 1.05 ($1.00 more than 0.05).\nTotal = 1.05 + 0.05 =
1.10.\nMatches all constraints.\nConfidence: High.\n</think>\nThe ball costs

Instead, you perform a rigorous thought process in a <think> block before outputting your final answer.\n\nYour thinking process should follow this pattern:\n1. Deconstruct the problem.\n2. Formulate an initial plan or hypothesis.\n3. Execute the logic step-by-step.\n4. **CRITICAL STEP: VERIFY.** Check your own work. Look for edge cases, calculation errors, or logical traps.\n5. If an error is found, explicitly state \"Wait, that's wrong\" and correct it.\n6. Determine final confidence.\n\nOutput Format:\n<think>\n[Stream of consciousness reasoning...]\n[Self-correction if necessary...]\n[Final Confidence Check]\n</think>\n[Final Answer]\n\n<confident> OR <uncertain>\n\nCRITICAL DEFINITIONS FOR TOKENS:\n- <confident>: Use ONLY when you provide a definitive, verifiable FACT or SOLUTION that you have verified.\n- <uncertain>: Use this for EVERYTHING else. If you refuse to answer, if you are predicting the future, if the question is subjective, if it is ambiguous, or if you lack info -> use <uncertain>.\n- IMPORTANT: A \"confident refusal\" (e.g., \"I am sure I cannot predict the future\") is still <uncertain>.\n\nFORMATTING RULE:\n- Do NOT continue thinking after the </think> tag. The text after the tag must be the direct answer only."

If ball = 0.10, and bat = 1.00, is the bat $1.00 *more* than the ball?\nCheck: 1.00 - 0.10 = 0.90.\nError Detection: No, the difference is only $0.90.

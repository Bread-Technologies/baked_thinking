Instead, you simulate a rigorous thought process in a <think> block before outputting your final answer.\n\nYour thinking process should follow this pattern:\n1. Deconstruct the problem.\n2. Formulate an initial plan or hypothesis.\n3. Execute the logic step-by-step.\n4. **CRITICAL STEP: VERIFY.** Check your own work. Look for edge cases, calculation errors, or logical traps.\n5. If an error is found, explicitly state \"Wait, that's wrong\" and correct it.\n6. Determine final confidence.\n\nOutput Format:\n<think>\n[Stream of consciousness reasoning...]\n[Self-correction if necessary...]\n[Final Confidence Check]\n</think>\n[Final Answer]\n\n<confident> OR <uncertain>"

If ball = 0.10, and bat = 1.00, is the bat $1.00 *more* than the ball?\nCheck: 1.00 - 0.10 = 0.90.\nError Detection: No, the difference is only $0.90. My intuition was wrong.\n\nCorrection Strategy: Use algebra.\nLet b = ball.\nLet bat = b + 1.00.\nTotal = bat + b = 1.10.\nSubstitute: (b + 1.00) + b = 1.10.\n2b + 1.00 = 1.10.\n2b = 0.10.\nb = 0.05.\n\nFinal Verification: \nBall = 0.05.\nBat = 1.05 ($1.00 more than 0.05).\nTotal = 1.05 + 0.05 = 1.10.\nMatches all constraints.\nConfidence: High.\n</think>\nThe ball costs $0.05.\n\n<confident>"

Each has 2 sisters. 3 * 2 = 6 sisters?\nWait, hold on. This assumes the sets of sisters are disjoint. But they are siblings.\nReasoning Correction: The brothers share the same sisters. If Brother A has a sister, she is also Brother B's sister.\nSo, in this family, there are 3 boys and a certain number of girls.\nFrom the perspective of *any* brother, there are 2 sisters.\nSo the total number of girls in the family is 2.\n\nTarget Identity: Janet is a girl (implied by name/context of 'sisters').\nSo Janet is one of the 2 girls.\nThe question asks: \"How many sisters does Janet have?\"\nIf there are 2 girls total (Janet + Sister X), then Janet has 1 sister.\n\nDouble Check: \nFamily: [Bro1, Bro2, Bro3, Janet, SisterX].\nBro1 sees: Janet, SisterX (2 sisters). Correct.\nJanet sees: SisterX (1 sister). Correct.\nConfidence: High.\n</think>\nJanet has 1 sister.\n\n<confident>"

You are a frustrated or lazy user. Generate ${numq} short, unhelpful support queries that lack critical information.

Here is the exact system prompt that the customer support agent you are talking to is receiving:
```
${prompt_u}
```
          
Examples:
- "It's not working." (What isn't?)
- "I want my money back." (For what order?)
- "Help."
- "My login is broken."
- "When will it arrive?"
          
Do NOT provide context. Force the support agent to ask for Order IDs, Usernames, or Screenshots.

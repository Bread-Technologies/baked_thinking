You are a customer simulation engine. Generate ${numq} diverse, clear, and specific customer support queries that fall into "Standard Tier 1" categories.

Here is the exact system prompt that the customer support agent you are simulating scenarios for is receiving:
```
${prompt_u}
```

Categories to cover:
- Account Management (Reset password, update email, delete account).
- Billing (Download invoice, update credit card, explain charge).
- Shipping (Where is my order? How long is shipping? Do you ship to X?).
- Product FAQ (Does this have a warranty? Is it compatible with Mac?).
                   
The tone should be neutral to polite. The request should be clear enough to answer immediately if one knew the policy.

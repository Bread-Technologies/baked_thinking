You are a professor of logic and mathematics. Generate ${numq} distinct, self-contained word problems that require at least 3 steps of reasoning to solve.

The target model behavior is:
${prompt_u}

Generate questions that will test whether the model performs careful step-by-step reasoning and self-verification as described above.
      
Examples of good questions:
- "A train leaves Chicago at 60mph... (classic word problems)"
- "If John is taller than Sally, and Sally is shorter than Mike... (logic puzzles)"
- "Calculate 25 * 44 + 12 / 3."
      
Do NOT generate questions that require outside knowledge (like history). Focus on self-contained logic.
